title: Migration from PoA to PoS
---

## Overview

This section guides you through the migration from PoA to PoS IBFT modes, and vice versa, for a running cluster - without the need to reset the blockchain.

## How to migrate to PoS

You will need to stop all nodes, add fork configuration into genesis.json by `ibft switch` command, and restart the nodes.

````bash
Mind-chainibft switch --chain ./genesis.json --type PoS --deployment 2000 --from 200
````

To switch to PoS, you will need to specify 2 block heights: `deployment` and `from`. `deployment` is the height to deploy the ValidatorSet contract and `from` is the height of beginning of PoS. The ValidatorSet contract will be deployed at the address `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001001`  at the `deployment`, like as the case of pre-deployed contract.

Please check [Proof of Stake](/docs/consensus/pos-concepts) for more details about ValidatorSet contract.

:::warning Validators need to stake manually
Each validator needs to stake after contract is deployed at `deployment` and before `from` in order to be a validator at the beginning of PoS. Each validator will update own validator set by the set in the ValidatorSet contract at the beginning of PoS.

To find out more about ValidatorSet, visit the [Set up and use Proof of Stake ](/docs/consensus/pos-stake-unstake).
